A compiled list of useful development tools


## Terminal Software
Not just Emulators
* kiTTy [for windows](http://www.9bis.net/kitty/?#!index.md)
  - A fork of the classic PuTTy
  - Extra features including multiple session launcher, automatic login scripts and more.
* [Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
  - A much more modern styled terminal emulator
  - Plenty of profile setup options, native tab splitting, rich text, themes etc.
* [Tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby) formerly Terminus
  - More feature rich than MS Terminal, but slightly heavier.
  - Loads of options for SSH connections, including encrypted vault, agent forwarding
  - My personal choice of the above.
